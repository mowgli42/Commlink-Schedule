schema: spec-driven

context: |
  Tech stack: JavaScript, Svelte 5, SvelteKit, Leaflet.js, Plotly.js
  Database: SQLite (better-sqlite3) + JSON flat files
  Address book: Commlink-Directory XML format
  Design: IxDF guidelines, dark theme, responsive
  Progress tracking: Beads (bd CLI)

  Domain: Military/enterprise communication link tracking
  Assets: Mobile ground units, aircraft, fixed sites
  Links: Satellite (GEO/MEO/LEO), line-of-sight radio, VoIP, XMPP
  Reports: Node status, frequency allocation, satellite usage, link availability

rules:
  specs:
    - All comm link types must define frequency, bandwidth, and protocol
    - Assets must have platform type (site, mobile, aircraft) matching Commlink-Directory schema
    - Geographic coordinates use WGS84 (lat/lon decimal degrees)
    - Time values use ISO 8601 with timezone
  tasks:
    - Each task should be trackable via Beads
    - UI tasks must reference IxDF design principles applied
    - Data tasks must include JSON schema validation
  design:
    - Follow IxDF principles: visibility, feedback, constraints, consistency, affordance
    - Dark theme as default with high-contrast operational colors
    - Map-centric layout with collapsible side panels
    - Responsive: desktop sidebar → mobile stacked
